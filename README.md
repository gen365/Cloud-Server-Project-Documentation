Below are brief samples of the code used to build the webpages of my website:

- HomePage-
[HomePage.md](CreationofWebpages-HomePage.md)

- Men Section Page-
[MenSectionPage.md](CreationofWebpages-MenSection.md)

- Female Section Page-
[FemaleSectionPage.md](CreationofWebpages-WomenSection.md)

- Accessories Section Page-
[AccessoriesSectionPage.md](CreationofWebpages-AccessoriesSection.md)

While making these webpages, seemingly minor but obviously important syntax errors were present
so these errors were identified and fixed for the webpages to be deployed successfully.


After creation of the webpages for the website, additional pages such as the contact and about page
are made. Find them below:
