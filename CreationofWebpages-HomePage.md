Homepage

I have written the code for the homepage, which serves as the main entry point to the website. 
It includes navigation links to all other sections and introduces the overall design, layout, and purpose of the site.

Here is an image:

This image displays the beginning code of the homepage, up until where the images and links for the first
section, which is the make section, are added. In the same manner, the second-female section, and third-accessories
sections are added to the page in the same way.
